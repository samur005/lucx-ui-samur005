### Pattern 1ag: P2P on, clients still cannot ping each other (lucx.224)
- **Symptom:** inbound `p2p` is on, `.conf` already `AllowedIPs = 0.0.0.0/0`, but `.2` cannot reach `.3`.
- **Cause:** `routeThroughXray` policy rule `iif awgN lookup 1000+N` still steals dest=subnet into tunN, or leftover `FORWARD -i awgN -o awgN DROP`. Userspace/no-module: not supported.
- **Check:** AWG diagnostics line `p2p`. Expect `dest <subnet> lookup main` (Xray mode) or no hairpin DROP (kernel-NAT). Reconcile (10s) re-adds; toggle does not bounce the iface.
- **Not this:** extra AllowedIPs outside the inbound /24 (site-to-site) — v1 hairpin is subnet-only.

### Pattern 1z: first install — GitHub git 401, no awg-quick — FIXED (lucx.203)
- **Symptom (Igor, 02.09.2026):** first install → “AWG module not installed”. Cores → Install hung on `Username for 'https://github.com'` then `HTTP 401` cloning `amneziawg-tools`.
- **Cause:** `git_clone_sha` used `git fetch` (smart HTTP). GitHub 401 makes git prompt for a password on a headless install, then fail. Panel install is best-effort, so AWG is simply missing.
- **Fix:** download `codeload.github.com/.../tar.gz/<pin>` (archive fallback) with `GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0`. Never prompt. DKMS version = pin SHA when the tree has no `.git`.
- **Healing:** `x-ui install-awg` / Cores → Install after update.

### Pattern 1: AWG inbound won’t start
- **Cause:** `awg-quick` not installed or kernel module not loaded. Since lucx.131 the module is installed by default again on `install.sh` (lucx.130 was opt-in, reverted by owner decision). v3.8 overlay dropped the call in .246; lucx.248 restored it in `install.sh` and `update.sh`. Hosts installed in lucx.130–131 or on .246 without the module stay without it until manual install.
- **Fix:** `x-ui install-awg` / Settings → Cores → Install / `bash /usr/local/x-ui/bin/install-awg-module.sh`. Rollback: `x-ui uninstall-awg` (`.conf` kept). Check `awg show`, `ip link show awgN`.
- **Cores button “doesn’t install”:** the panel runs the script with `--no-kernel-upgrade` + `DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive` (else apt/needrestart hangs without TTY). Watch logs `awg: rebuild | …`; status `rebuildRunning` spins while the build runs. After success a reboot is usually not needed.
- **DKMS build fail with headers present:** Pattern 1s (udp_tunnel ABI on kernel ≥ 7.1.5).

### Pattern 1b: AWG inbound won’t start after upgrade — "iptables: command not found"
- **Cause:** Debian 13+ doesn’t ship iptables out of the box (nftables only). PostUp with MASQUERADE/FORWARD (appeared in lucx.20) fails with exit 127 → awg-quick rolls back → awgN never comes up. Hits installs upgraded from versions < lucx.20 (iptables wasn’t required before). In logs: `awg-quick: line 295: iptables: command not found` + `reconcile failed ... exit status 127`.
- **Fix:** `apt-get install -y iptables` (installs a shim over nf_tables — our rules work transparently). Reconcile will bring the interface up within ≤10 s. Fresh installs covered: `bin/install-awg-module.sh` installs iptables as a dependency (since 2026-07-18).
- **Seen on:** lucx-test1 (144.31.224.212) on upgrade lucx.17 → lucx.33, 2026-07-18.

### Pattern 1c: AWG outbounds “won’t connect” after panel upgrade (module desync) — FIXED (lucx.51)
- **Cause:** A major upstream amneziawg module upgrade (like AWG1 → AWG3 in lucx.50, `v3.0.20260731`) requires a **DKMS module rebuild**. `bin/install-awg-module.sh` does that, but `update.sh` (shared path for web panel and console `x-ui update`) did NOT call it — the module stayed old, the new binary started with new settings → handshake failed. Symptom: “connection is there but won’t connect”, rolling back to the previous release fixes it.
- **Fix (lucx.51, skip-if-current lucx.145):** `update.sh` compares marker `/etc/x-ui/.awg-module-version` (commit SHA from `install-awg-module.sh`) with `git ls-remote` of upstream master. Mismatch → `--force-rebuild` before `systemctl start x-ui` (panel stopped, rmmod safe). Matching SHA → call without `--force-rebuild`; the script exits before apt/kernel/DKMS. No network + module already present → leave it. Non-fatal: rebuild error does not block panel start.
- **Seen on:** tester Alexander on upgrade to lucx.50 via web panel — AWG 1.5 outbounds wouldn’t connect; retry via console `x-ui` menu fixed it (2026-08-01). From lucx.51 web update should rebuild the module automatically.

### Pattern 1d: AWG inbound “Device awgN does not exist” when operator picked v3 on a v1.x module — FIXED (lucx.53)
- **Cause:** Migration-prune (migrateAwgVersion) gates AWG3 fields (HPK + 6 device timers/padding + AdvancedSecurity) only by `awgVersion != "3"`. If the operator picked v3 in the form but the host is still on amneziawg kernel module v1.x, the fields go into .conf → v1 module rejects “Line unrecognized: ContentPaddingAddition=64” in setconf → awg-quick rolls back the interface → “Device awgN does not exist”. Symptom: AWG inbound won’t come up, logs show `awg setconf ... Configuration parsing error`. Reproduced on lucx-test2 (module v1.0.20260611).
- **Fix (lucx.53, probe rewritten in lucx.58):** `ModuleSupportsAwg3()` (platform_{linux,other}.go). All 4 renderers (renderServerConf, renderClientConf, inboundAwgHints + transitively sub/service.go via Prune AWG3 fields) double-gated: `AwgVersion == "3" && ModuleSupportsAwg3()`. Tests override via `SetModuleSupportsAwg3(&bool)`. **lucx.53 implementation (major=="3" from `modinfo -F version`) was broken in principle:** upstream stamps `PACKAGE_VERSION="1.0.0"` in dkms.conf/Makefile of EVERY release, so both v1 and v3 modules report “1.0.0” — the gate never fired, HPK was silently dropped on every host. **lucx.58:** functional probe — symbol `awg_header_protection_set_key` in `/proc/kallsyms` (kernel) + major from `awg version` ≥ 3 (tools < v3 don’t parse the HPK line in .conf). Cache only the positive result. See Pattern 1j.
- **Lesson:** DB-stored `awgVersion` is the ceiling the operator chose, not runtime capabilities. Need an explicit capability check at every AWG3 field emission point — and probe the **feature** (symbol/behavior), not a version string.

### Pattern 1e: “connect works, no traffic” — two AWG inbounds on the same subnet (kernel route conflict) — FIXED (lucx.54)
- **Cause:** Form default `createDefaultAwgInboundSettings` hardcodes `address: '10.8.0.1/24'` for every new AWG inbound. Two back-to-back inbounds get the **identical client subnet 10.8.0.0/24** → kernel installs two connected routes on one prefix (`10.8.0.0/24 dev awg2` + `10.8.0.0/24 dev awg4`). Linux picks one by metric/order, the other is a zombie. Reverse path from server to clients of the second inbound goes out the preferred interface (awg2), where that pubkey peer isn’t registered → packets dropped → clients on awg4 see handshake (UDP port input doesn’t depend on route) but get no data traffic.
- **Symptom (tester VladufQa, 2026-08-03):** “connect works traffic doesn’t”. awg2 + awg4 both UP, `ip rule iif awg4 lookup 1004` + `default dev tun4 table 1004` in place (TUN routing healthy), MASQUERADE/FORWARD in place. But reverse path in kernel route 10.8.0.0/24 → awg2 (zombie for awg4).
- **Fix (lucx.54):** Advisory warning in the AWG form (`AwgFields`) — `watch('settings.address')` + `useMemo` over masked subnets of other AWG inbounds (`otherAwgSubnets` prop, passed from `InboundFormModal` via `dbInbounds`). Pure functions `maskSubnet`/`subnetsOverlap` in `frontend/src/lib/awg/subnet.ts` (IPv4, 32-bit int, no npm deps). `<Alert type="warning">` (advisory, does NOT block save — back-compat for existing dup-subnet inbounds).
- **We don’t:** server-side guard / refuse saving dup-subnet (intentional — breaks back-compat; operator may deliberately want overlap).
- **Added (lucx.56):** auto-suggest next free /24 — `suggestFreeAwgAddress(usedSubnets)` in `frontend/src/lib/awg/subnet.ts`, applied to `settings.address` when picking AWG protocol in add mode (`InboundFormModal` protocol-change effect). New AWG inbound immediately gets a free subnet (10.8.N.0/24, if the whole /16 is taken — 10.9+). Two-layer defense: auto-suggest prevents on create, warning catches manual input.
- **Added (lucx.63) — server-side block:** `checkAwgSubnetConflict(newAddr, ignoreId)` in `inbound.go` parses the address → `netip.Prefix.Masked()` and via `Overlaps()` checks all AWG inbounds. `AddInbound` blocks a new duplicate; `UpdateInbound` blocks only a **change** of subnet to a conflicting one (masked old vs new) — editing an existing dup inbound without changing subnet is allowed (back-compat). Frontend advisory warning kept as instant feedback. Third defense layer: auto-suggest (prevents) → warning (catches manual) → server block (last line).
- **Added (lucx.64) — leave 10.8.0.0/24 + conflict with outbounds:** (a) Form default and `defaultAwgBase` changed from **10.8.0.0/24 → 10.200.0.0/24**; auto-suggest scans 10.200.0.0/24..10.220.255.0/24. Reason: 10.8.0.0/24 is the most popular subnet of upstream WireGuard/AmneziaWG servers, and AWG-**outbounds** (awgo-N, .conf from provider) almost always get an address there → two connected routes on one prefix → same “handshake ok, no traffic” (Vlad: 10.8.5.1/24 works, 10.8.0.1/24 is “cursed”). (b) `checkAwgSubnetConflict` now also checks **AWG outbounds** (`outboundAddresses(false)` — all, including disabled) via pure helper `awgOutboundSubnetConflict`: block only when `oP.Bits() <= newNet.Bits() && Overlaps` (/32 exempt — doesn’t create a /24 connected route, its IP is already covered by exclusion in `defaultAwgClients`). Existing inbounds on 10.8.0.0/24 created before lucx.64 are NOT auto-healed — operator changes the address manually (triggers `migrateAwgClientSubnets`).
- **Lesson:** Form default for network-address fields must be **unique per inbound**, or the form must warn on conflict. Connected-route conflict doesn’t fail awg-quick up (interface comes up) and silently breaks reverse path → diagnostics sees “everything UP” but no traffic. Default subnet should be far from ranges used by **external** servers (upstream WireGuard 10.6/10.7/10.8) — otherwise AWG outbounds connecting to them take the same subnet.

### Pattern 1f: Per-client peer-level field on model.Client doesn’t save — FIXED (lucx.54)
- **Cause:** Frontend sends `clientPayload.advancedSecurity = true`, but backend `model.Client` struct **had no** `AdvancedSecurity` field → `json.Unmarshal` silently drops unknown keys (standard Go) → field never written to Settings JSON → after reload switch is OFF. `ClientRecord` (gorm table `clients`) also had no column, and `ToRecord`/`ToClient` didn’t copy it.
- **Symptom (tester VladufQa, 2026-08-03):** “I flip the switch, hit save, and it turns off”. AWG3 AdvancedSecurity switch toggles ON, after save returns to OFF.
- **Fix (lucx.54):** Field added at **5 points** in `model.go` for full round-trip: `Client` struct (json tag) + `ClientRecord` struct (gorm column `awg_advanced_security`) + `ToRecord()` (copy) + `ToClient()` (copy) + merge logic. AutoMigrate adds the column on next start.
- **Fix (lucx.61):** Merge logic “true wins, never silently clear” (`incoming.AdvancedSecurity && !existing.AdvancedSecurity`) wouldn’t let you **turn the switch off** — condition is false when `incoming=false`, so ON→OFF was impossible. For `bool` the zero-value `false` is a valid value (turn off), not “field absent” (unlike `int`/`string` where 0/"" = absent). Fix: `if incoming.AdvancedSecurity != existing.AdvancedSecurity` — takes incoming directly. Plus: AdvancedSecurity is **no longer emitted into .conf** (server, outbound-client, and user) — the kernel ignores the field on input (`set_peer`) and hardcodes "off" in dumps (`get_peer`); emission only broke parsing in older client apps. Field stays in model/DB for future kernel support. Removed from fingerprint (change no longer triggers an extra restart).
- **Lesson:** A per-client peer-level field on `model.Client` needs **5 points** for a full round-trip, NOT one struct field. `ClientRecord` is the gorm `clients` table, used on **all** save paths (`db.go`, `client_crud.go`, `client_link.go`, `client_portable.go`, `client_bulk.go`, `client_traffic.go`). `Client` struct alone is not enough — the field is lost on the Client→Record→DB→Record→Client cycle. AWG sidecar reads the field via `InstanceFromInbound` (raw JSON settings), but the universal `ClientFormModal` save flow goes through `controller/client.go` → `model.Client` → `ToRecord` → `ClientRecord`. By contrast, the 6 device fields (ContentPaddingAddition etc.) are **not** hit by this — they live on `inbound.settings` (inbound-level), not per-client `model.Client`.

### Pattern 1g: “create a client → interface dies, delete it → comes back” — empty PSK in renderServerConf — FIXED (lucx.55)
- **Cause:** `renderServerConf` (`internal/awg/manager.go`) wrote `PresharedKey = %s` **unconditionally**, even with empty PSK → line `PresharedKey = ` with empty value. awg-tools reject it: `awg setconf` → `Line unrecognized: 'PresharedKey='` + `Configuration parsing error` → awg-quick rolls back the interface → “Device awgN does not exist”. Empty PSK arrives when the client is created via a path that doesn’t call `defaultAwgClients` (PSK generator): that only runs from `addInboundClient` (Clients page → `ClientService.Create`), not the inbound form path (`InboundService.UpdateInbound`). Reproduced on test2: empty PSK → setconf EXIT=1, omit → EXIT=0.
- **Mismatch that exposed the bug:** `renderClientConf` (client_conf.go:96) and `SyncPeers` (manager.go:659) already omit empty PSK (`if psk != ""`); only `renderServerConf` always wrote it.
- **Fix (lucx.55):** `renderServerConf` omits empty/whitespace-only PSK (`if psk := strings.TrimSpace(p.PSK); psk != ""`), matching renderClientConf/SyncPeers. Missing `PresharedKey` is the WireGuard convention for “no PSK”. 3 regression tests in `server_conf_psk_test.go`.
- **Lesson:** A renderer of an optional `.conf` field must **omit an empty value**, not write `Key = ` — awg-tools reject empty values, awg-quick rolls back the interface, reconcile fails forever. Any peer-level param that can be empty on some client-create path must be gated `if value != ""`. Check all three renderers (renderServerConf / renderClientConf / SyncPeers) for consistency.

### Pattern 1h: changing AWG inbound address doesn’t migrate client AllowedIPs → interface dies — FIXED (lucx.59 migration + lucx.63 allocation base)
- **Cause:** an inbound client gets AllowedIPs from the inbound subnet at creation (`defaultAwgClients`). When the operator **changes the inbound address** (e.g. 10.8.0.1/24 → 10.8.2.1/24 to escape dup-subnet Pattern 1e), existing clients’ AllowedIPs **stay on the old subnet** (10.8.0.2/32). On `awg-quick up` awg-quick adds a route for each peer AllowedIPs: `ip -4 route add 10.8.0.2/32 dev awg6`. If the old subnet is owned by another inbound (awg7 on 10.8.0.0/24) → `RTNETLINK answers: File exists` → awg-quick rolls back → “Device awgN does not exist”. Reproduced from VladufQa logs (lucx.56).
- **Symptom:** after changing Address, logs show `reconcile failed ... ip -4 route add <old IP> dev awgN` + `RTNETLINK: File exists` + `ip link delete`.
- **Fix (lucx.59):** `migrateAwgClientSubnets(oldAddr, newAddr, settings)` in `client_awg.go`, called from `UpdateInbound` on address change — re-allocates single-host clients from the old subnet into the new one (keys/PSK/email kept), custom entries (0.0.0.0/0, foreign subnet, IPv6) untouched.
- **Added (lucx.63) — root of “client with foreign IP”:** `defaultAwgClients` computed the allocation base via `wireguardAllocationBase(used, fallback)` — that takes the **/24 of the first used IP** from `used` (including awgo-* outbound IPs from the collision guard). With an active AWG outbound on 10.8.0.x the first client of inbound 15.11.5.0/24 got 10.8.0.x → route in the wrong place → same RTNETLINK conflict, but **already at create**, not on address change. Plus `allocateWireguardAddress` widened the pool to /16 when /24 filled (issuing addresses outside the inbound subnet). **Fix:** base = `awgAllocationFallback(serverAddr)` (inbound subnet only); `allocateWireguardAddress(used, base, widen)` — AWG passes `widen=false` (full /24 → error, no spill into neighbors). “Need to restart Xray for the inbound to come alive” (VladufQa) — consequence: route conflict → reconcile failed forever, RestartXray just triggered an immediate Reconcile.
- **Lesson:** client addresses allocated from the inbound subnet are bound to that subnet at create time. Changing the inbound subnet invalidates them — need a migration. And the allocation base must come FROM THE INBOUND SUBNET, not from the first used IP in the exclusion list (exclusion list ≠ source of truth for the base).

### Pattern 1i: deleting an inbound left .conf + ModuleSupportsAwg3 cached on error — FIXED (lucx.57)
- **Cause 1:** `Manager.Remove(id)` deleted `awg{id}.conf` only when the interface was running (entry in `m.procs`). An inbound whose interface never came up (setconf/route failed) had no entry → `.conf` survived inbound deletion (VladufQa’s question “why doesn’t it delete configs”). Configs live in `/etc/amnezia/amneziawg/` (awgConfigDir), NOT `/etc/awg/`.
- **Cause 2:** `ModuleSupportsAwg3` set `moduleAwg3Checked=true` BEFORE `modinfo`; a transient modinfo error (module rebuilding during update) cached “not v3” for the whole process → AWG3 fields silently dropped until restart.
- **Fix (lucx.57):** `Remove` deletes `.conf` unconditionally; `Reconcile` adds `sweepOrphanInboundConfigs(want)` (cleans `awg{N}.conf` of unwanted ids with no procs entry; `parseInboundConfName` doesn’t match `awgo-*.conf`); `ModuleSupportsAwg3` doesn’t cache on `err != nil` (re-probes).
- **Lesson:** cleanup tied to “running” entities skips exactly the ones that never started (and those leave the garbage). Side-effect files must be deleted by id unconditionally.

### Pattern 1j: “module v1.x / not v3” by version string — false; rebuild version-gate never worked — FIXED (lucx.58)
- **Cause 1 (AWG3 detect):** `ModuleSupportsAwg3` parsed major from `modinfo -F version amneziawg` and expected “3”. Upstream stamps `PACKAGE_VERSION="1.0.0"` (dkms.conf) and `WIREGUARD_VERSION=1.0.0` (Makefile) in every release — both v1 tags (v1.0.20260611) and v3 tags (v3.0.20260731) produce a “1.0.0” module. Gate never fired → HPK was emitted on NO host (VladufQa symptom “HeaderProtectionKey still never appeared in the config”, even after a rebuild from master).
- **Cause 2 (rebuild gate in update.sh):** compared `grep -oP 'version\s*"\K[^"]+' src/dkms.conf` with the marker. In dkms.conf the variable is UPPERCASE (`PACKAGE_VERSION=`) → grep matched empty → “up to date” → module was **never rebuilt** for the entire life of the gate (lucx.51+). On VladufQa’s host the module stayed June-era (pre-HPK) after every update.
- **Fix (lucx.58):**
  1. `ModuleSupportsAwg3` = functional probe: symbol `awg_header_protection_set_key` in `/proc/kallsyms` (only on AWG3 module, and only when loaded) + `awg version` major ≥ 3 (tools < v3 don’t parse the HPK line in .conf). Cache true only; false = transient → retry every call (upgrade picked up without panel restart).
  2. Marker `/etc/x-ui/.awg-module-version` = **build commit SHA**; gate in update.sh = `git ls-remote refs/heads/master` (no clone). Legacy markers ≠ SHA → one-shot rebuild on every host at first lucx.58 update.
  3. **Auto kernel upgrade** only when a module rebuild is due (SHA mismatch / `--force-rebuild`), not on every install-awg-module.sh call (lucx.145). update.sh reboots into the new kernel at end of update only after that rebuild.
  4. Build-first-safe: new DKMS tree compiles while the old is loaded; swap only after successful build. Module is built for ALL installed kernels with headers. Tools rebuild when `awg version` < v3.
- **Verification (test2, 2026-08-03):** kernel 6.12.90→6.12.100; old module (marker 1.0.20260611, tools v1.0.20260618-2) → `--force-rebuild` → module v3.0.20260731-04 (kallsyms symbol present), tools v3.0.20260730, marker = master SHA; reconcile recreated awg3/awgo-* in one tick; old lucx.49 binary + v2 config works on v3 module (back-compat), `awg show dump` format unchanged.
- **Hot-swap nuance:** with the panel running rmmod may fail (interfaces hold the module) — then the new module is picked up after reboot/panel restart. In normal update.sh the panel is stopped before the AWG hook, so swap is clean there.
- **Lesson 1:** external component versions (dkms/modinfo) are often constant across major protocol releases. Want capability — probe the feature (kernel symbol, binary behavior), not a string.
- **Lesson 2:** a shell gate on foreign file contents must be checked end-to-end on a real file: a grep that didn’t match an UPPERCASE variable silently disabled the gate for 3 releases. For “build freshness” compare commit SHAs — version strings lie.

### Pattern 1k: orphan-sweep deleted OTHER people’s AWG configs (WGDashboard) — FIXED (lucx.67)
- **Cause:** `sweepOrphanInboundConfigs` (reconcile, every 10s) deleted **any** `awg{N}.conf` in `/etc/amnezia/amneziawg/` whose ID wasn’t among current LucX-UI inbounds. WGDashboard configs share the same names (`awg0.conf`…) and the same folder → wiped as “orphans”; a file restored from backup vanishes again within ≤10s (tester symptom: “WGDashboard interfaces magically died, won’t come up from backup”).
- **Fix (lucx.67) — ownership by marker + backup instead of delete:**
  1. `renderServerConf` writes a first-line marker `# Managed by x-ui - do not edit` (awg-quick ignores `#` comments). `awgConfigDir` became a `var` (tests override), `awgBackupDir()` = `awgConfigDir + "/x-ui-backup"`.
  2. `sweepOrphanInboundConfigs`: a config not in `want` is removed only if it carries the marker (LucX-UI), and is **moved** to `x-ui-backup/awg{N}.conf.<unixtime>`, not deleted. Foreign ones (no marker) are **left alone**. Helpers `configIsManaged`, `backupConfigFile`.
  3. `Remove(id)` and the reconcile loop (procs no longer wanted) also **backup** instead of delete; delete only if backup failed.
  4. Marking existing LucX-UI configs (created before the fix): on reconcile for inbounds in `want` whose config has no marker — rewrite via `renderServerConf` (content is deterministic, fingerprint unchanged → no restart).
- **Lesson:** `/etc/amnezia/amneziawg/` is shared with other tools (WGDashboard). An “orphan” sweep by name pattern `awg{N}.conf` must distinguish OWN configs (ownership marker), not treat everything ownerless as ours; prefer move-to-backup over delete.
- **lucx.165:** the same rule applies to *live interfaces*. `killStrayAwgInterfaces` used to `ip link del` every `awg`+digit at first reconcile (even with zero LucX AWG inbounds), which killed toolza/awg-multi `awg0`/`awg1` within ~10s of panel start. It now calls `strayInterfaceIsOurs` (managed marker only). Import of those foreign ifaces is opt-in: Inbounds banner → preview → `Manager.Adopt` (rename in place).

### Pattern 1l: “connect works, no traffic” + client keeps old IP on re-attach to AWG — FIXED (lucx.91)
- **Cause:** `defaultAwgClients` only fills EMPTY credentials (“existing values are never overwritten”). A client detached from an AWG inbound and re-attached — after the inbound subnet changed or from another AWG inbound — dragged the old single-host address from the clients-table row. Chain: awg-quick installs a peer /32 route onto a foreign subnet → either RTNETLINK conflict and interface rolls back (“stuck in starting…”), or the peer comes up but the server doesn’t own the address’s subnet → handshake succeeds (keys match), traffic dies. Report VladufQa + Aleksandr SacredX on lucx.85–90.
- **Fix (lucx.91), 3 layers:**
  1. `awgAllowedIPsStale` (client_awg.go): all entries are single-host (/32 or /128) AND at least one is outside the current inbound subnet → stale. Customs (0.0.0.0/0, non-host) never touched. Re-allocation right in `defaultAwgClients` on attach — keys/PSK kept, only address rotates. **Still active in lucx.92** — fires only on explicit client (re)attach, which is an operator action.
  2. Startup migration `migrateAwgStaleClients` (internal/database, in LUCX-HOOK db.go): fixed ALREADY-saved stale clients without manual re-attach. **DISABLED in lucx.92** (`awgStaleMigrationEnabled = false`), **removed in lucx.123**: in lucx.91 it ran automatically on live servers at panel start — changing addresses without operator consent was judged a mistake, even though it only touched already-broken clients. A year of code under `const false` is code nobody reads and nobody tests; if needed it lives in history (`git show v3.6.0-lucx.122 -- internal/database/migrate_awg_stale_clients.go`). Rollback for servers that ran lucx.91: `journalctl -u x-ui | grep 'migration.*address'` prints `client "email" address OLD -> NEW` per rotated client; restore the old address manually via allowedIPs on the client card. Usually no rollback needed — those clients were broken before rotation.
  3. After address rotation the client must re-download the config (panel/subscription) — the old app config still has the stale address.
- **Rollback for hosts already migrated on lucx.91:** no backup was kept; the only old→new record is the panel journal: `journalctl -u x-ui | grep 'migration.*address'` (lines `client "email" address OLD -> NEW`). Rollback is rarely needed: rotated clients didn’t work before migration, the new address is valid — just re-download the config. Restore old address — manually in the client’s allowedIPs.
- **Lesson:** “never overwrite existing” is safe for keys, but NOT for addresses bound to the inbound subnet: an address issued from a subnet goes stale with it. Any re-attach must check the single-host address against the CURRENT subnet. **And the main lucx.92 lesson:** data migrations at panel start MUST NOT be automatic — on live servers any change is opt-in only (explicit operator action); only idempotent no-ops on a fresh DB may run automatically.

### Pattern 1n: overlay 3x-ui → Clients “Something went wrong” / Scan wg_keep_alive int64 — FIXED (lucx.119)
- **Cause:** LucX changed `Client.KeepAlive` / `ClientRecord.KeepAlive` from `int` to `KeepAliveValue` (string) for AWG3 ranges (`"15-25"`). Upstream column `clients.wg_keep_alive` stays INTEGER; sqlite driver returns `int64`. Without `sql.Scanner` database/sql: `unsupported Scan, storing driver.Value type int64 into type *model.KeepAliveValue` on `Find(&[]ClientRecord)` (Clients page, ListForInbound → Xray config).
- **Symptom:** after install/update over vanilla 3x-ui red screen “Get (sql: Scan error on column … wg_keep_alive …)”. Fresh LucX DB (TEXT) — OK; only overlay breaks.
- **Fix (lucx.119):** `KeepAliveValue.Scan`/`Value` (`model.go`) — int64/string/[]byte/float64/nil; Postgres `migrateClientKeepAliveColumnType` (`migrate_awg_keepalive.go`) widen → text before AutoMigrate; frontend WG inbound `optionalKeepAlive` accepts number|string (after LucX write-back `"25"`).
- **Lesson:** changing a field type on a column upstream created = Rule 0b. AutoMigrate + `type:text` on SQLite does **not** rewrite affinity of old rows. Test the legacy INTEGER path, not only a fresh DB. See Rule 0b.

### Pattern 1g: Web update “broke” panel/Xray — headless prompts (FIXED lucx.66, verified by repro)
- **Cause:** web update (`updatePanel`) runs `update.sh` via `systemd-run` **without TTY** (stdin=/dev/null). Old `update.sh` had unconditional interactive prompts (`read -rp` loop for server_ip and SSL wizard) that in headless read EOF forever / fell into default “issue Let’s Encrypt” with the panel stopped → panel/Xray stayed down.
- **Fix (lucx.66):** detect `lucx_interactive=[[ -t 0 ]]`; in headless the server_ip loop and SSL wizard are **skipped** (SSL is configured later from console/panel). `update.sh` for web update is always downloaded **fresh** from `main` (`panelUpdaterURL`), so the fix applies even when upgrading from old builds.
- **Verification (2026-08-05, stand 144.31.224.212):** old build `v3.6.0-lucx.63` installed, then web update (`updatePanel` via API with CSRF) → update unit “Deactivated successfully”, log “Non-interactive update: skipping SSL setup”, x-ui active, xray listening, version became lucx.74. **Does not fail.** Historical “crashes” = pre-lucx.66 headless bug; current update.sh is healthy.
- **Lesson:** any `read -rp` in a script launched via systemd-run from the panel must be wrapped in an interactive guard; repro “old build → web update” is the only way to be sure the upgrade path didn’t regress.

### Pattern 4: routeThroughXray — no internet
- **Cause 1:** needRestart didn’t fire → Xray didn’t regenerate config → TUN not created.
  **Fix:** Check `awgRoutesThroughXray` in `inbound.go` (AddInbound/DelInbound/UpdateInbound/SetInboundEnable).
- **Cause 2:** `ip rule iif awgN lookup 1000+N` missing or route in table 1000+N lost (tunN recreated).
  **Fix:** `ip rule show | grep awg`, `ip route show table 1000+N`. Reconcile loop (10s) should restore.
- **Cause 3:** TUN gateway conflicts with AWG subnet.
  **Fix:** gateway must be `10.254.(N%254).1/30` (per-inbound /30, not AWG subnet).
- **Cause 4:** Domain rules don’t work (SNI not visible).
  **Fix:** TUN inbound (AWG/qWDTT) and sidecar SOCKS bridge (mieru/TT/naive/olcrtc, `injectSocksEgress`) must have `sniffing: {http,tls,quic, routeOnly:true}` (`awgEgressTunSniffing` in `xray.go`). Without it the sidecar hands SOCKS an already-resolved IP → `geosite:youtube` is silent, traffic goes to default outbound. Hysteria is a native Xray inbound: sniffing is toggled in the inbound form (default off).

### Pattern 5: Xray dies "this rule has no effective fields"
- **Cause:** Routing rule without `outboundTag`/`balancerTag`/`domain`/`ip` — only `type` and `inboundTag`.
  **Fix:** Check routing template config in the panel. `injectAwgEgress` doesn’t create a rule with empty `outboundTag` (Xray catch-all). If the rule comes from the template — remove the empty rule.

### Pattern 6: AWG client won’t connect — server version vs client version (lucx.50+)
- **Cause:** The real compatibility boundary is the **server** config, not client-config length. AmneziaWG fields split into:
  - **must-match** (server↔client must match): `S1`–`S4`, `H1`–`H4`, `HeaderProtectionKey`. If server is v3 (with HPK) and client is v2 — handshake fails on must-match fields.
  - **may-differ**: `Jc`/`Jmin`/`Jmax`, `I1`–`I5`.
  - **version-gated**: `S3`/`S4` + `I1`–`I5` appeared in AWG v2 (Android 2.0.1); `HeaderProtectionKey` — in AWG v3 (desktop 5.0.0.5 / Android 3.0.1).
- **Fix:**
  - The `awgVersion` selector on the inbound sets the **server ceiling** — which fields the server will accept. A v3 server will NOT accept v1/v2/plain-WG clients (HPK cryptographically breaks compatibility).
  - For a mixed client fleet (some old, some new) — **create a separate v2 inbound** (no HPK). A v2 server accepts both v2 and v1.5 clients.
  - In the client modal (`ClientQrModal`/`ClientInfoModal`) the “Client config version” selector lets you export a config ≤ the inbound ceiling. That only **avoids parse errors** in an old client app (extra fields are stripped), but does NOT give compatibility if the client is older than the server.
  - ⚠️ HPK requires S1–S4 ≥ 12 (generator guarantees it; on manual input check — form shows `awgSRangeWarning`).
- **Symptom:** client hangs on handshake, server logs show `awg0` peer with no handshake. Compare must-match fields in server `.conf` (`/etc/awg/awgN.conf`) and client — any mismatch = the cause.
- **What clients actually support (snapshot 2026-08-14, issue #44 analysis).** The panel issues a correct AWG3 config; “won’t import” almost always is the client, not the server:

  | Client | Version at snapshot | AWG 3 / HPK | AWG 3.1 |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | AmneziaVPN | 5.0.0.5 (2026-07-26) | Claimed in changelog | No (3.1 landed in amneziawg-go ~2026-08-12) |
  | AmneziaWG for Windows (standalone) | 2.0.2 (2026-07-21) | **No** — release predates AWG3, no HPK parser → “incorrect HeaderProtectionKey” expected | No |
  | FlClash | current | **No** (Clash/mihomo stack doesn’t know HPK) | No |
  | Throne + ThroneAWGcore | core v0.1.0 | **No** — documents only Jc/S/H/I | No |

  - “AmneziaVPN shows version 2 and won’t connect” = import dropped HPK, and the v3 server requires it → handshake won’t complete (see must-match above).
  - Practical default for a Windows-client fleet — **separate inbound `awgVersion = 2`**; don’t set `3.1` until there is at least one stable GUI client.
  - Before blaming the client, check the module is really AWG3: `grep awg_header_protection_set_key /proc/kallsyms`, `awg version` ≥ v3. If HPK never appears in the exported `.conf` — module/tools are old, fixed by `x-ui update`.

### Pattern 9: “proxy/tun: connection was refused / operation timed out” spam on a HEALTHY server — benign client noise (diagnosis 2026-08-06, NOT a bug)
- **Symptom:** logs constantly show `ERROR - XRAY: proxy/tun: connection was refused` (and less often `operation timed out`, `connection reset by peer`), in bursts of 15–74 over 1–4 s, while “everything works”: handshakes fresh, traffic flows, NO other errors in the journal.
- **When this is NOT Pattern 8:** awgo outbound subnet does NOT overlap inbound client subnets (check `ip -4 -br addr` + .confs), DNS on inbounds is working. Then the cause is below.
- **Root source:** xray-core `proxy/tun/stack_gvisor.go` — gvisor-netstack TCP forwarder: `ep, err := r.CreateEndpoint(&wq); if err != nil { errors.LogError(t.ctx, err.String()) }`. `CreateEndpoint` blocks until the 3-way handshake **between netstack and the AWG client** finishes (client SYN → netstack SYN-ACK → client ACK) and fails if the client didn’t complete the handshake. The strings are `String()` of gvisor `tcpip` errors (pkg/tcpip/errors.go): `ErrConnectionRefused` = “connection was refused”, `ErrTimeout` = “operation timed out”, `ErrConnectionReset` = “connection reset by peer”.
- **Semantics (gvisor `tcp/handshake`, synRcvdState/synSentState):** `refused` = client sent **RST during handshake** (aborted a connection it itself started — app cancelled connect, device slept/switched network, client OS closes a batch of half-open sockets at once → burst). `timed out` = netstack retransmitted SYN-ACK until retries exhausted and the client’s final ACK never arrived (packet loss on the last hop / client gone).
- **Verification (VladufQa stand 195.133.32.18, lucx.74):** in 24h 636 errors (570 refused / 65 timeout / 1 reset) — the ONLY error type for the whole period; errors span the ENTIRE journal history (since 21.07) across all panel versions → not a regression. AF_PACKET capture on tun2/tun13 (150 s, python without tcpdump): 86 healthy connections, 0 broken handshakes in the window; one timeout case caught — netstack sends SYN-ACK 5× to `Work-PC → 213.59.253.21:443` with no client ACK, and exactly when the timeout expires the journal gets `operation timed out`. Direct 1:1 correlation.
- **Conclusion:** Xray logs incomplete client handshakes at ERROR level — noise from mobile/sleeping clients (family phones, browser connection-racing, doze). NOT a panel/AWG/routing bug; nothing to fix, log can’t be suppressed via Xray settings (ERROR is always written). Distinguish from Pattern 8: there errors SPAM only with a live awgo carrying traffic and vanish when it’s disabled + there is subnet overlap.
- **Diagnostics without tcpdump** (tcpdump may not be installed, and installing packages is forbidden): python3 script with `socket.AF_PACKET, SOCK_RAW` on tun interfaces (read-only sniff), parse IPv4/TCP flags, track SYN/SYN-ACK/ACK/RST per 4-tuple; correlate capture window with `journalctl -u x-ui` by minute. Client IP→email mapped from DB: `sqlite3 /etc/x-ui/x-ui.db "select settings from inbounds where protocol='awg'"` → `clients[].email` + `clients[].allowedIPs`.

### Pattern 1q: AWG client AllowedIPs “saves and reverts” — FIXED (lucx.134)
- **Symptom (VladufQa):** change IP on the client card — it saves, after reload it’s the old one. To get the needed address on a second hoster, spawned fake clients and deleted the extras.
- **Cause:** `ClientService.Update`/`Create`/`bulk` always did `per.AllowedIPs = nil` on AWG/WG so multi-attach wouldn’t copy one IP onto different subnets. Empty field → `fillAwgClients` allocates the next free (often the same old one). Operator input was discarded even with a single inbound.
- **Fix (lucx.134):** `clearBroadcastTunnelIP` clears IP only if that save has more than one AWG/WG inbound. One tunnel — write as in the form (collision is still an error).
- **We don’t:** two inbounds on one panel with the same subnet (Pattern 1e). Matching IPs on **different** servers is exactly what manual AllowedIPs is for.
- **Lesson:** broadcast protection must not silence the only legitimate way to set an address.

### Pattern 1r: “Failed to fetch” downloading subscription + AWG has no speed — FIXED (lucx.135)
- **Symptom (Kirill/Chingiz):** on the client card Download for SUB/AMNEZIA gives “Failed to fetch”; Copy for AMNEZIA pastes the URL instead of the body; on the public sub page AWG only has amneziawg; the “Speed” column for AWG clients is forever “—”, while “Traffic” grows.
- **Cause 1 (CORS):** the sub server listens on a separate port with no CORS headers; browser `fetch` from the panel origin fails when origins differ (common setup). Only vpn:// worked via same-origin `awgBody` (lucx.98).
- **Cause 2 (speed):** the “Speed” column = deltas of the 5-second `XrayTrafficJob` broadcast; AWG never hits Xray’s stats API (kernel TUN). DB totals are written by `AwgJob` — so “Traffic” is visible, “Speed” isn’t.
- **Fix (lucx.135):** (1) `GET /panel/api/clients/subBody?url=…` — loopback to the local sub server (path+query only, host ignored; Host=subDomain for DomainValidator; neutral UA); frontend — all modal rows via `fetchSubscriptionBody`, Copy for AMNEZIA = config body; sub page gets `PageData.SubAwgUrl` and an AMNEZIA row (.conf/vpn:// — `<a href>` with attachment headers, copy = same-origin fetch). (2) `awg_speed_buffer.go` + LUCX-HOOK in `xray_traffic_job.go` — AWG deltas normalized to 5 s are folded into the same broadcast frame.
- **Lesson:** a public listener without CORS ≠ a data source for the panel browser; any “download body” in the UI goes through a same-origin proxy. Live speed = broadcast deltas only; everything metered outside Xray (AWG, mtproto, tunnel) must fold its deltas into the shared frame.

### Pattern 1s: DKMS “check kernel headers” but headers are fine — udp_tunnel ABI (kernel ≥ 7.1.5) — FIXED (lucx.147)

- **Cause:** Linux 7.1.5 changed `udp_tunnel_sock_release` / `setup_udp_tunnel_sock` from `struct socket *` to `struct sock *` (stable backport of Kuniyuki Iwashima’s udp_tunnel series). `amneziawg-linux-kernel-module` before `v3.1.20260828` still passed `struct socket *`. GCC 14 treats `-Wincompatible-pointer-types` as an error → `socket.o` fails. Headers **are** present; the old script message was wrong. Distros (Debian 13 `7.1.7+deb13`, CachyOS) ship this ABI under a 7.1.x `LINUX_VERSION_CODE`, so a version `#if` is not enough.
- **Symptom:** `x-ui install-awg` / Cores → Install: clone succeeds, `dkms build` exit 2, “Ошибка сборки DKMS”. `make.log` shows `expected ‘struct sock *’ but argument is of type ‘struct socket *’` in `sock_free` / `wg_socket_init`. Build-first-safe leaves the old module loaded — do not reboot onto 7.1.x without a built module.
- **Fix (lucx.147):** `bin/install-awg-module.sh` after clone applies the PR #218 wrappers (`__builtin_types_compatible_p` on the real signature) unless `wg_udp_tunnel_sock_release` is already in `socket.c` (no-op once upstream merges). DKMS failure prints the tail of `make.log` instead of blaming headers.
- **Upstream:** the 7.1.5+ fix landed in tag `v3.1.20260828` (lucx.218 pin). In-script PR #218 wrappers stay as a no-op if `wg_udp_tunnel_sock_release` is already in `socket.c`.
- **Seen on:** zinn65de-lc, kernel `7.1.7+deb13-amd64`, 2026-08-20.
- **Workaround without a panel update:** boot 6.12 and rebuild; or apply PR #218 on the cloned tree and `dkms build` by hand. Do not reboot into 7.1.5+ until the module builds.
- **Lesson:** a DKMS fail with headers in `/lib/modules/$(uname -r)/build` is an upstream ABI/source mismatch, not a missing-headers problem. Dump `make.log`. Kernel API changes that distros backport cannot be gated by `LINUX_VERSION_CODE`.

### Pattern 1t: add client → peer missing, table 100N empty, syncconf loop — FIXED (lucx.154)

- **Cause:** lucx.153 `awg syncconf` was fed the awg-quick `.conf`. Parser rejects `Address=` / `MTU=` / `PostUp=`. `Ensure` returned before `ensureXrayRouting`. Only inbounds whose peer set changed were hit.
- **Symptom:** `WARNING - awg: syncconf awgN: exit status 1`; `awg show awgN dump` has no new peer; `ip route show table 100N` empty. Handshake can work after a manual peer add, traffic cannot.
- **Fix:** `stripAwgQuick` + temp file for `syncconf`. Full `.conf` stays for `awg-quick up`. After update the next reconcile retries (peerFP not saved on failure) and restores the route.
- **Seen on:** Kirill, v3.6.0-lucx.153, amneziawg-tools v3.1.20260812, awgVersion 2 and 3.1.

### Pattern 1u: multi-attach subscription repeats one Address — FIXED (lucx.154)

- **Cause:** `clients.wg_allowed_ips` is one field; `/awg/` (`BuildAwgClientConf`), `/sub/` (`genAwgLink`), `/clash/` (`buildAwgProxy`) read it. Per-inbound IPs live in `settings.clients[].allowedIPs`. Panel QR already used `inboundAwgPeerAddresses`.
- **Symptom:** two AWG inbounds, one client → both `.conf` blocks share one Address; handshake ok, traffic dies on the other subnet. Card in the panel shows the right IPs.
- **Fix:** `AwgClientTunnelAddress` prefers `InboundAwgPeerAddresses(settings)[email]`, table field as fallback. Storage not unified (Rule 0).
- **Seen on:** Kirill, v3.6.0-lucx.153.

### Pattern 1v: routeThroughXray off → handshake ok, packets leave as 10.x — FIXED (lucx.156)

- **Cause:** kernel NAT was mark-only (`mangle PREROUTING MARK` + `POSTROUTING -m mark MASQUERADE`). After toggling off routeThroughXray the MARK rule was often missing; MASQUERADE by mark never matched. Packets egressed with the tunnel source.
- **Fix:** also install `-s <clientSubnet> -o <ext> MASQUERADE`. Mark path kept for peers outside the server /24. Reconcile deletes leftover `iif awgN lookup 100N`.
- **Seen on:** Kirill, 2026-08-22. Manual workaround was the same `-s` rule.

### Pattern 1w: Pro QUIC I1–I5 crashes awg-tools (segfault / glibc abort) — FIXED (lucx.156)

- **Cause:** tools netlink buffer is one page (4096). I1–I5 are hex-put without bounds. QUIC Pro sum 1696–2044 B → ~35% of generated configs crash `awg set`/`setconf` on Linux.
- **Fix:** `GenerateCPS` keeps payload ≤ 1800 B (retry, then drop I5…I2). Real fix is upstream [amneziawg-tools#69](https://github.com/amnezia-vpn/amneziawg-tools/issues/69).
- **Not done:** MTU-clamp of I1 (needs form to send MTU). I1 stays ~1198 (QUIC minimum).

### Pattern 1y: kernel card Stopped / 0 interfaces while module is loaded — FIXED (lucx.173)

- **Cause:** lucx.169 `KernelAvailable` used `sync.Once`. First probe often false (module not loaded yet at first Xray start, or `LookPath("awg-quick")` on a thin systemd PATH). Cache stuck false → `AwgJob` `Reconcile(nil)`, `applyLocalAwg` no-op, LucX `awg` inbounds forced onto amneziawg-go. HostStatus live-probes `/sys/module/amneziawg`, so the UI shows module loaded + Stopped + 0 interfaces.
- **Fix:** cache true only; retry every call while false. Probe via `awgBin` (LookPath + `/usr/bin` …).

### Pattern 1z: new AWG client .conf has no PresharedKey — FIXED (lucx.175)

- **Cause:** lucx.165 skipped PSK generation when `publicKey`/`privateKey` were already set (import). The inbound/client form always generates a keypair first, so every new AWG client hit that skip. Export omits an empty PSK (correct for WireGuard; Amnezia analyzers want the line).
- **Fix:** generate PSK when the client is **new** (`existing` has no matching email/pubkey). Imported/existing empty PSK stays empty (Rule 0).
- **Seen on:** Albert, 2026-08-24.

### Pattern 1aa: AWG share-link used form password as PSK — FIXED (lucx.176)

- **Cause:** `awgPeerShape` did `preSharedKey ?? password`. Empty PSK fell through to the 16-char form password. Same class of bug as lucx.173 on the export path.
- **Fix:** only `preSharedKey`. H1–H4 in `inboundAwgHints` written by index (no `H =` rematch). Create-time `fillProtocolDefaults` mints one PSK for all attaches.
- **Seen on:** Albert (fresh 169), Never (172 “broke everything”).

### Pattern 1z: new AWG clients do not connect — `Key is not the correct length: 'vgmg…'` — FIXED (lucx.173)

- **Cause:** `InstanceFromInbound` used `clients[].password` as PresharedKey when PSK was empty. Client form always sends `password` = `NumLower(16)`. `awg syncconf` rejects it; one bad peer blocks the whole iface. Old kernel peers stay (syncconf failed, state unchanged). Re-export of an old client also fails if settings now carry that password.
- **Fix:** password → PSK only for the legacy id/password pair (`publicKey` absent). Form password is ignored.
- **Seen on:** VladufQa inbound 32; Never new Amnezia clients.

### Pattern 1x: Import existing AWG finds nothing while Docker Amnezia is running — FIXED (lucx.171)

- **Cause:** official Amnezia `run_container.sh` does **not** bind-mount `/opt/amnezia`. Configs live only inside `amnezia-awg` / `amnezia-awg2` / `amnezia-wireguard` at `/opt/amnezia/awg/awg0.conf` (legacy `wg0.conf`). Discover only walked the host path, so preview said “no unmanaged interfaces”.
- **Fix:** `scanLiveDocker` lists `docker ps` and `docker exec cat` those paths. Host `/opt/amnezia` scan kept for bind-mounts. Dedupe by private key.
- **Seen on:** live host with three Amnezia containers (2026-08-24).

### Pattern 1y: Import finds Docker AWG but only vanilla WG commits — FIXED (lucx.172)

- **Cause:** `Validate` required S1–S4 ≥ 12 always. Official Amnezia 1.5 omits S3/S4 (0); AWG2 often has S3=1. Vanilla WG (`Jc=0,S1=0`) skipped the check, so only it imported. Next trap: all three stacks use `10.8.1.0/24` — `checkAwgSubnetConflict` would refuse the rest.
- **Fix:** S≥12 only with HeaderProtectionKey. Import sets `awgImportInProgress` (do not rewrite IPs). Operator must stop Docker and change a subnet before bringing more than one kernel iface up.
- **Seen on:** estonia-zakez-ru, 2026-08-24.

### Pattern 1ab: after Docker import the kernel iface cannot bind the port — FIXED (lucx.177)

- **Cause:** commit saved the inbound disabled (`DropOnImport`) so Amnezia Docker kept the UDP port. Operator had to `docker stop` by hand.
- **Fix:** successful import stops that source (`docker stop` + `--restart=no`, or `systemctl stop awg3`) then enables the inbound. Container is not removed. Stop failure does not roll back the saved inbound.
- **Seen on:** estonia-zakez-ru, 2026-08-24.

### Pattern 1ac: live kernel import cannot rename awg0 → awgN — FIXED (lucx.206)

- **Symptom:** commit reports `saved, adopt failed: ip link set awg0 name awg1: Device or resource busy`. Inbound exists in the DB. Reconcile every 10s creates `awg1`, hits `Address already in use`, deletes it. Live `awg0` stays up.
- **Cause:** Linux will not rename an UP netdev. Import saved the inbound enabled, so `AddInbound` raced Adopt and tried to `awg-quick up awg1` beside the live iface. Failed Adopt left the row in the DB.
- **Fix:** `renameAwgInterfaceSeq` does admin-down → rename → up. Commit saves disabled, Adopt, then enable. Adopt failure `DelInbound`s the row.
- **Seen on:** n1 replica of dns (awg0 :55555), 2026-09-03.

### Pattern 1ad: disable client → attach second AWG → enable, neither connects — FIXED

- **Symptom (Never):** client on awg2 works; disable; attach awg3.1; enable. Neither connects. New configs still dead. Delete client, create on both inbounds at once → OK.
- **Cause:** Clients page enable switch is a full `Update` that omits keys/PSK. `Create` reuses stored PSK; `Update` did not, so `fillProtocolDefaults` minted a **new PSK per inbound**. Issued .conf still has the old PSK. Two inbounds → two new PSKs; the record keeps the last one.
- **Fix:** `Update` copies empty PrivateKey/PublicKey/PreSharedKey from the record, same as `Create`.
- **Healing:** panel update, then re-download .conf (PSK already rotated). Or delete+recreate the client.
- **Lesson:** any partial client save that can hit `fillProtocolDefaults` must preserve tunnel credentials the way Create does.

### Pattern 1ag: DKMS fail on Ubuntu 22.04 5.15.0-194 — `timer_delete` redeclared — FIXED (lucx.267)

- **Symptom (MasyGreen, issue #114):** fresh install / `x-ui install-awg` on `5.15.0-194-generic`. DKMS exit 2. `make.log`: `static declaration of timer_delete follows non-static declaration` in `compat.h`. Panel is up; AWG module is not.
- **Cause:** lucx.207 always dropped the `ISUBUNTU2204` skip so the `del_timer` wrapper applied. That fixed `5.15.0-82` (no `timer_delete`). `5.15.0-194` backported the symbol; the static wrapper collides.
- **Fix:** probe `/lib/modules/$BUILD_K/build/include/linux/timer.h` for `timer_delete(`. Declared → leave upstream skip. Absent → apply the wrap.
- **Healing:** update, then `x-ui install-awg`.

### Pattern 1ae: DKMS fail on Ubuntu 22.04 5.15 — `timer_delete` — FIXED

- **Symptom:** `x-ui install-awg` / first install: DKMS exit 2, old module left. `make.log`: `implicit declaration of function ‘timer_delete’` in `device.c` / `wg_pm_notification`. Kernel `5.15.0-82-generic`.
- **Cause:** pin `46803204e7ec` `compat.h` wraps `timer_delete` → `del_timer` for kernels `< 6.1.91`, but skips `ISUBUNTU2204` (assumed backport). 5.15.0-82 has no backport.
- **Fix:** `apply_timer_delete_compat` drops the Ubuntu 22.04 exception after clone. Keep `ISUBUNTU2004` — 5.4.0-216 declares `timer_delete`.
- **Healing:** update panel, then `x-ui install-awg` / Cores → Install.
- **Not a bug (was):** `tproxy`/`mtproxy` curl 404 — they are release-built, never on GitHub raw. install/update now skip that fetch.

### Pattern 1af: DKMS fail on Ubuntu 20.04 5.4 — `chacha_init` undeclared — FIXED (lucx.251)

- **Symptom (VladufQa, 19.09.2026):** web update to lucx.250 ran `install-awg-module.sh`; DKMS exit 2; panel “AWG module not installed”. `make.log`: `‘chacha_init’ undeclared` / `‘chacha20_crypt’ undeclared` in `compat.h` `__compat_chacha_init`. Kernel `5.4.0-216-generic`. Reboot does nothing — module was never built.
- **Cause:** AWG 3 header protection uses the ChaCha library API. Linux 5.5+ has `chacha_init(u32 *state, …)` / `chacha20_crypt`. The pin’s `< 6.16` wrapper assumes that API and calls `(chacha_init)(state->x, …)`. 5.4 still ships the skcipher `crypto/chacha.h` (`crypto_chacha_init` / `chacha_block`) — include succeeds, symbols do not. Upstream issue #210 / PR #244 (open; PR only shadows the header for VERSION<5.5, which loses to the kernel header already present on 5.4).
- **Fix:** after clone: `apply_chacha_lib_compat` (Zinc `chacha_init`/`chacha20_crypt` on `< 5.5`) and `apply_blake2s_zinc_compat` (do not `#include <crypto/blake2s.h>` on `< 5.10`, where Zinc still builds `blake2s.o`). 5.5–6.15 keep the kernel ChaCha library. Do not drop `ISUBUNTU2004` on `timer_delete`.
- **Healing:** update panel, then `x-ui install-awg` / Cores → Install. No reboot if DKMS installs for the running kernel.
- **Not this:** Debian 13 (6.12 / 7.1.x) — Pattern 1s (udp_tunnel ABI). Ubuntu 22.04 5.15 already has `chacha_init` — Pattern 1ae.

### Pattern 1ah: first install + SSL → AWG script never runs — FIXED

- **Symptom (Igor, 21.09.2026):** fresh install, panel “AWG module not installed”. No dkms, no marker, no journal `awg: rebuild`. Ubuntu 26.04 / kernel 7.0 — headers fine; `x-ui install-awg` then builds in ~1 min.
- **Cause:** `config_after_install` → `install_acme` does `cd ~`. The LUCX-HOOK then tests `-x bin/install-awg-module.sh` relative to cwd (`/root/bin/…` missing) and **silently skips**. Same in `update.sh` after SSL.
- **Fix:** hook uses `${xui_folder}/bin/install-awg-module.sh`. Else prints the missing path.
- **Healing:** `x-ui install-awg` / Cores → Install (already absolute). No reboot if DKMS built for the running kernel.
